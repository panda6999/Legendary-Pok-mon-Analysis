📌 Project Overview
This project is a data analysis script written in Python that explores the statistical differences between Legendary and Non-Legendary Pokémon. Using the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, the script calculates the average base statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) to quantitatively demonstrate the "power gap" inherent in Legendary Pokémon designs.

🚀 Features
Data Loading: Ingests raw Pokémon data (CSV format) directly within the script.

Data Grouping: Aggregates data based on the Legendary boolean flag.

Statistical Analysis: Calculates the mean values for all major battle statistics:

HP

Attack & Defense

Special Attack & Special Defense

Speed

Visualization: Generates a comparative bar chart to visualize the stat disparity.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Pandas: For DataFrame creation, grouping, and aggregation.

Matplotlib: For plotting the statistical comparison bar chart.

IO (Standard Lib): For parsing string-based CSV data.
